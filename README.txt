  In CPSC350, I am most excited for assignments and projects. Although
I struggle with testing, lectures, and reading, I enjoy working on
assignments and writing code. The projects and assignments weren't
too difficult in Python, Java, and Visual Programming, so it will be
nice to have a challenge.
